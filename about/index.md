<img class="rounded-picture" style="float: right" src="/img/avatar.jpg">
A 30 years old French software engineer, located in Paris.

For the past 9 years or so, I've been part of the [VideoLAN](https://www.videolan.org) community, and have contributed to VLC & related projects.

My job previously led me to Estonia, where I was working for Skype, in the video team. I relocated in July 2014 to join a smaller company, Videolabs, that allows me to
work on VideoLAN projects as a full time job, which is great!

I have done quite a bit on VLC lately. In no particular order, I appear to now be responsible for the UPnP stack, windows toolchains (And will manage Windows releases starting from 3.0 release, which is a cool but a bit scary responsability).
I'm working a bit on the chromecast support, Qt interface, direct3d9 video output, ...

While my interests codewise are mostly revolving around C++ (which is why I hope to be able to provide some nice articles about that here), I also write code in C, go, C#, among others, and I really should look into rust & D.

And for what it's worth, I play bass in [Cepheide](https://cepheide.bandcamp.com/)
