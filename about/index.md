<img class="rounded-picture" style="float: right" src="/img/avatar.jpg">
A 27 years old French software engineer, located in Paris.

For the past 7 years or so, I've been part of the [VideoLAN](https://www.videolan.org) community, and have contributed to VLC & related projects.

My job previously led me to Estonia, where I was working for Skype, in the video team. I relocated in July 2015 to join a smaller company, Videolabs, that allows me to
work on VideoLAN projects as a full time job, which is great!

My latest contribution would be compiling VLC using Visual Studio, in order to be able to provide WindowsRT/Windows Phone VLC builds.

While my interests codewise are mostly revolving around C++ (which is why I hope to be able to provide some nice articles about that here), I also write code in C, go, C#, among others, and I really should look into rust & D.

You can contact me through:

- irc (irc.freenode.org, #videolan)
- twitter: @beauzeh
- IRL in Paris or maybe at a conference, somewhere!
